#Comparison operator
#greater than
#You can ask a question using the >(greater than) operator.
#if you want to know if there are more black sheep than white ones,you can write it as follows

#black_sheep > white_sheep

#greater than or equal to
#The greater than or equal to
##The greater than operator has another special ,non-strict,but denoted differently than in classical arithemetic notation >=

#centigrade >=0.0

#Comparison  operators :Less than/Less than or equal to
#As you have probably already guessed the operator used in this cases are: <(less than) operator and its non-strict siblings
#<=(less than or equal to
