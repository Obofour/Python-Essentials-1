#You already know python ask question.You have to have a mechanism which allow you to do something if a condition is met and not do it if it isn't
#To make such decision,Python offers a special instruction called condition instruction
# if true_not_not:
    #do_this_if_true
#else:
    #do_otherwise

#Nested if-else statement
#First consider the case where the instruction placed after if is another if

#Read and code the following instruction
#if the weather is good,we will go for a walk.iif we find a nice restaurant,we'll have lunch there,Otherewise we'll have sandwich,if weather is poor we will go to the theater if there is no ticket we will go for shopping

#if weather_is_fine:
    #if nice_restaurant_is_found:
        #have_lunch()
    #else:
        #eat_a_sandwich
#else:
    #if tickets_are_available:
        #go_to_the_weather
    #else:
        #go_shopping()


#Using elif
#just use to check more than one condition and stop if the first statement is true

#if the_weather_is_good:
    #go_for_a_walk()
#elif ticket_are_available:
    #go_to_the_theater()
#else:
    #play_chess()
