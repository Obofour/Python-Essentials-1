print("Hello,World")

#what happens when python encounters an invocation like this below?
# function_name(argument)

#1.python first if it is legal
#2.Python checks if the functions requirement for the number of argument allows you to invoke the function
#3.Python leaves your code for a moment and jumps to the function you want to invoke
