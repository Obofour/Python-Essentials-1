#if you want to give a name to a variable,you must follow some strict rules
#1.the name of the variables must be composed of upper-case letters,digit,and character(underscore).
#2.the name of the variable must begin with a letter
#3.upper-and lower-case letters are treated as different
#4.the name of the variables must not be any of python reserved words(the keywords-we'll explain about this soon)

#Note that the same restrictions apply to function names

#python does not impose restriction on the length of variable names,but that does not mean that long variable names are better than short one

#How to create a variable.
#A variable comes into existence as a result of assigning a value to it.unlike in other languages ,you do not need to do anything else.

#The creation(syntax) is extremely simple:just use the desire variable the equal sign(=) and te value you want to put into the variable

var=1
print(var)
