#it is time for the next set of operators that makes the developer's life easier.we want to use one and the same variable both to the right and left side of(=) the operator
#for example it we need to calculate a series of successive value of 2,we may use a piece like

# x= x*2
#You may use an expression like this if you cant you are trying to deal with it using some good old-fashioned method

#Python Offers you a shortened way of writing operator like these
# x *=2
# sheep +=1
