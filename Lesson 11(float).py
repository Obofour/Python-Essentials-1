#it is time to talk about another type,which is designed and to store the number that a mathematician will say non-empty decimal fraction
#whenever we use the term two and half or minus zero point four we think of numbers which a float.consider the floating point 2.5 and -0,4

print(type(2.5))
print(type(-0.4))

#int vrs float
#Decimal point are essential for recognizing numbers in python look at these;
print(type(4))#is an integer
print((type(4.0)))#is a float


#Also it's not only point that make  a float . You can use Letter e.
 #When you want to use any number that are very large or small,you can use scientific notation
 #for example the speed of light,expressed in meter per second.written directly like this
 #300000000
 #To avoid writing out many zeros,physics textbook use an abbreviation form,which you have probably already seen:
 # 3 x 10^8

 #it reads 3 times  10 to the power 8;

 #in python the same effect is achieved in a slightly different way - take a look
#3E8

#the letter E(you can use lower-case (e))-it cones from the word exponent)

#Note
#The exponent(the value of E) has to be an integer
#the base(the value in front of the E) can either be an integer or float

print(0.000000000007)
